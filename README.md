# Repository Overview

Hi! My name is Adi and this is my repository as I attempt to do Advent of Code using Python. 

I'm a Data Scientist by trade, so I'll try to showcase data science packages and libraries. 

## Advent of Code

From the advent of code website: 

> Advent of Code is an Advent calendar of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill sets and skill levels that can be solved in any programming language you like. People use them as interview prep, company training, university coursework, practice problems, a speed contest, or to challenge each other.

You can check out the Advent of Code platform [here](https://adventofcode.com/2023/about)
